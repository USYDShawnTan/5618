# Initial Quality Assurance Mechanisms

## Quality Assurance Process

1. **Walkthrough Procedures**  
   Does the GeoGebra development team conduct regular code walkthroughs to maintain high-quality code? We need to check official development documentation or contribution guidelines.

2. **Code Review Process**  
   Does GeoGebra implement a GitHub Pull Request review system? Are there strict code submission policies?

3. **Software Evaluation**  
   Has the software undergone user testing, performance testing, and compatibility testing? Have the developers published any evaluation reports?

## Quality Roles

- Does the project have a designated **Quality Manager** or **Quality Engineer**?
- Is there a dedicated testing team, or is testing handled by developers?

## Testing Mechanisms

- Does the source code include unit tests or automated testing?
- Is a Continuous Integration (CI) tool (e.g., GitHub Actions) used to automate test execution?
- Is there a bug tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issues) to manage defects?

## Identified Issues and Recommendations

1. **Lack of a unified testing framework**: Introduce a structured testing framework like JUnit or PyTest.
2. **Incomplete code documentation**: Some API functionalities lack detailed documentationâ€”improve developer documentation.
3. **Community contribution quality control**: Enforce stricter code review mechanisms to prevent low-quality code from merging into the main branch.
4. **Optimizing the CI/CD process**: Enhance the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for more efficient software releases.
5. **Performance optimization**: Especially in 3D rendering, further optimization strategies are needed.
6. **User feedback system**: Introduce an in-app feedback mechanism to collect user suggestions quickly.
7. **Better mobile experience**: Optimize touch interactions to improve responsiveness and smoothness.
