# Project Description

## Functionality

GeoGebra is a powerful mathematics software that integrates visualization tools for geometry, algebra, statistics, and calculus. Users can construct dynamic geometric diagrams, plot functions, perform algebraic computations, analyze statistics, and conduct calculus operations. It also supports interactive teaching, making mathematical concepts more intuitive.

GeoGebra provides a rich set of tools, including the ability to draw points, lines, and circles, plot parametric curves, perform symbolic computations, and analyze statistical data through histograms and regression analysis. Additionally, it enables users to create interactive learning resources widely used in education.

## Target Users

The primary users of GeoGebra include:

1. **Teachers**: For classroom teaching, helping students visualize mathematical concepts and improving instructional efficiency.
2. **Students**: For conducting mathematical experiments and exploring concepts to enhance their understanding.
3. **Math Enthusiasts**: For mathematical modeling and solving complex mathematical problems.

In educational settings, GeoGebra is suitable for:

- **Primary Education**: Basic geometric shape recognition.
- **Secondary Education**: Algebra, functions, and calculus courses.
- **Higher Education & Research**: Advanced mathematical modeling and data analysis.

## Installation Process

1. **Download**: Visit [GeoGebra's official website](https://www.geogebra.org/) and download the appropriate installer for Windows, macOS, Linux, or mobile devices.
2. **Installation**: Run the downloaded file and follow the installation wizard instructions.
3. **Online Version**: Users can access GeoGebra directly via a web browser without installation.

## Upgrade Process

- **Automatic Updates**: By default, GeoGebra checks for updates upon launch and prompts users to install the latest version.
- **Manual Updates**: Users can download the latest version from the official website and install it over the existing version.
- **Web Version**: The online version is always up-to-date, requiring no manual updates.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. Enhance 3D rendering performance for smoother complex model visualization.
2. Provide more teaching templates to help teachers quickly create instructional content.
3. Improve mobile support by optimizing touch interaction.
4. Strengthen symbolic computation capabilities for more complex algebraic operations.
5. Offer API integration to allow third-party applications to extend GeoGebra.
6. Improve collaboration features for real-time online sharing and editing.
7. Introduce AI-powered tools to assist users in completing mathematical derivations.
8. Add programming support for scripting with Python or JavaScript.
9. Expand export options to include formats like LaTeX and SVG.
10. Enhance localization support with more comprehensive translations.
11. Improve cloud storage capabilities for better file management and synchronization.
12. Increase compatibility with other educational software such as Moodle and Canvas.

# Initial Quality Assurance Mechanisms

## Quality Assurance Process

1. **Walkthrough Procedures**  
   Does the GeoGebra development team conduct regular code walkthroughs to maintain high-quality code? We need to check official development documentation or contribution guidelines.

2. **Code Review Process**  
   Does GeoGebra implement a GitHub Pull Request review system? Are there strict code submission policies?

3. **Software Evaluation**  
   Has the software undergone user testing, performance testing, and compatibility testing? Have the developers published any evaluation reports?

## Quality Roles

- Does the project have a designated **Quality Manager** or **Quality Engineer**?
- Is there a dedicated testing team, or is testing handled by developers?

## Testing Mechanisms

- Does the source code include unit tests or automated testing?
- Is a Continuous Integration (CI) tool (e.g., GitHub Actions) used to automate test execution?
- Is there a bug tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issues) to manage defects?

## Identified Issues and Recommendations

1. **Lack of a unified testing framework**: Introduce a structured testing framework like JUnit or PyTest.
2. **Incomplete code documentation**: Some API functionalities lack detailed documentationâ€”improve developer documentation.
3. **Community contribution quality control**: Enforce stricter code review mechanisms to prevent low-quality code from merging into the main branch.
4. **Optimizing the CI/CD process**: Enhance the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for more efficient software releases.
5. **Performance optimization**: Especially in 3D rendering, further optimization strategies are needed.
6. **User feedback system**: Introduce an in-app feedback mechanism to collect user suggestions quickly.
7. **Better mobile experience**: Optimize touch interactions to improve responsiveness and smoothness.
