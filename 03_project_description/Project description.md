# Project Description

## Functionality

GeoGebra is a powerful mathematics software that integrates visualization tools for geometry, algebra, statistics, and calculus. Users can construct dynamic geometric diagrams, plot functions, perform algebraic computations, analyze statistics, and conduct calculus operations. It also supports interactive teaching, making mathematical concepts more intuitive.

GeoGebra provides a rich set of tools, including the ability to draw points, lines, and circles, plot parametric curves, perform symbolic computations, and analyze statistical data through histograms and regression analysis. Additionally, it enables users to create interactive learning resources widely used in education.

## Target Users

The primary users of GeoGebra include:

1. **Teachers**: For classroom teaching, helping students visualize mathematical concepts and improving instructional efficiency.
2. **Students**: For conducting mathematical experiments and exploring concepts to enhance their understanding.
3. **Math Enthusiasts**: For mathematical modeling and solving complex mathematical problems.

In educational settings, GeoGebra is suitable for:

- **Primary Education**: Basic geometric shape recognition.
- **Secondary Education**: Algebra, functions, and calculus courses.
- **Higher Education & Research**: Advanced mathematical modeling and data analysis.

## Installation Process
